1.  Recover data files and make a table of the metadata.
2.  Do the alignments and add to the table things like read number, number of reads aligned, number unique, etc
3.  Generate 100bp tile outputs and get this in a form that can be visualized by IGV.
4.  Call "peaks" for each modification using MACs and tile-based approaches
5.  Assess the overlap of the peaks with TEs and genes as done before.
6.  Develop metaprofiles of the counts for each mark over genes, LTR and TIR elements.
